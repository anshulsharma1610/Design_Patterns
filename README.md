Design Patterns
Welcome to "Design_Patterns," a comprehensive Java repository dedicated to demonstrating various design patterns in a practical, easy-to-understand manner. This repository serves as an educational resource for both beginners and experienced programmers who wish to deepen their understanding of design patterns in Java.

Introduction
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. They are essential for writing flexible and reusable code. This repository covers a range of design patterns, each implemented in the context of a simulated general store application.

Patterns Covered
Patterns Covered
1. Adapter Pattern
Manufacturer: Demonstrates how to adapt an interface into another according to client expectations. In this example, a manufacturer's details are adapted for use in the general store context.

2. Builder Pattern
BuilderAPI: Illustrates the Builder Pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step. This pattern is particularly useful for creating various types of objects with different configurations.

3. Command Pattern
BuyItemCommand: Implements the Command Pattern, encapsulating a request as an object, thereby allowing users to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.

4. Decorator Pattern
GiftDecorator: Showcases the Decorator Pattern, which adds new functionality to objects without altering their structure. This example demonstrates adding gift wrapping features to items.

5. Facade Pattern
OrderFacade: Simplifies complex library or framework interfaces with a unified, simplified interface. The OrderFacade simplifies the process of creating and managing orders.

6. Factory Pattern
AbstractFactory: Demonstrates the Factory Method Pattern, providing an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

7. Observer Pattern
Order: Implements the Observer Pattern, which is a subscription mechanism that allows multiple objects to listen to and react to events occurring in other objects.

8. Prototype Pattern
DeliveryType: Focuses on the Prototype Pattern, used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.

9. State Pattern
AwaitingConfirmationState: Showcases the State Pattern, allowing an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This example manages different states of an order.

10. Strategy Pattern
DiscountStrategy.java Implements the Strategy Pattern, enabling the selection of an algorithm's behavior at runtime. This example demonstrates applying different discount strategies.
